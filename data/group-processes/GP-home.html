		<p class="pt-2">As a group, we all agree that from the start of Assessment two, we were all eager and ready to go. Once the group formed, 
		and introductions were out of the way, and the communication started. Being lucky in the selection of our members from an open invitation, 
		we ended up having people from all backgrounds with varying skill sets.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Tasks were broken down to skill sets that suited each person the best we could, which gave us a quick start with the 
		content being completed at an early stage for everyone to read over and collaborate. All of us got along like we have had known each 
		other for years, and the support each of had given each other was beyond what any of us initially expected. We are all proud of what we 
		achieved together and could not be any happier with being part of The Fighting Mongooses.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">As we advance with assessment three, we will be taking into account daylight savings issues concerning meeting 
		scheduling. We will also be taking on board feedback from tutor and grader from Assessment two and nailing down the format and overall 
		design of our written report so that it will be on a similar level to the website.</p>
