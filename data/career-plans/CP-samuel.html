		<h5>Ideal Job: System Integration Officer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">My ideal job is as System Integration Officer. Specifically, integration for people with 
		impairments such as vision or auditory as well as other disabilities. The integration officer's main 
		objective is to seamlessly integrate humans and technology by developing, managing and maintaining integration 
		systems. This requires the integration officer to have a broad range of knowledge across a variety of I.T. 
		systems and combines elements of both frontend and backend development as well as an understanding of 
		business practices and people. A strong focus on data manipulation and automated systems are essential 
		for any position as an integration officer.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">As the system integration officer is required to work alongside all facets of information 
		technology, both technical and user-focused, the skills necessary overlap with many of my Fighting Mongoose 
		colleagues' ideal jobs. Adam (as a backend developer), Channon (as a cybersecurity officer) and Daniel 
		(as a systems administrator) all have technical focused ideal jobs. Strong knowledge of database systems and 
		structure is essential for all these occupations and technical aptitude in networked systems. Jorge and 
		Maddie's ideal jobs (both as I.T. support) also share similar skill sets with integration officers as both 
		roles require direct communication with user-end clients. The main difference between a systems integration 
		officer compared to the ideal jobs of my colleagues is that the integration officer is mainly responsible for 
		developing and maintain the tools that allow both sides to work together.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The most crucial baseline skills for integration officers, communication, ranks highly among my 
		colleagues. As communication is the most in-demand baseline skill based on Burning Glass Technologies' data, 
		this is no surprise. Furthermore, the required baseline skills in problem-solving, teamwork and organisational 
		skills also rank highly amongst my colleagues and myself. Perhaps my required baselines skills lean more towards 
		Maddie and Jorge's ideal jobs as both integration officers and I.T. support staff communicate heavily with user-end 
		clients and business management.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">As the required skills were similar to those of my colleagues, a wide variety of skills is essential 
		to assimilating to a team environment. Acting as an integration officer requires me to work alongside both frontend 
		and backend teams as well as finding solutions with clients and business entities.</p>
