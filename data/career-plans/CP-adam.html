		<h5>Ideal Job: Backend Developer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">My Ideal Job would be a Backend Developer. A <strong>Backend Developer</strong> in simple terms is a lot like a builder; they build a house from the foundation to 
		the structure (framework). They would then hand off to the <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> - or in the case of a builder, an Interior Designer - whose focus is on the customer-facing 
		aspects of the development or in other words what people are going to see.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">I find the role of a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> appealing as its more orientated to the work I find most appealing and exciting. However, I am also comfortable with 
		<strong>Frontend Development</strong> as the two roles do require quite a bit of crossover. These roles can also be combined into a single position which is 
		called <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> but again even though I have a lot of the skills required to be a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>; I prefer the complexities of 
		Backend Development work as to be perfectly honest we make the real magic happen.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My Chosen career path is very different from my fellow teammates, being they are more support and frontline orientated positions and will not require in-depth knowledge 
		or programming, databases, etc. However, there will be some crossover in skill sets at a minor level. Channon's chosen field of cybersecurity would have more crossover in skills with my chosen 
		field as <strong>Backend Developer</strong> as I would also need to take into account certain aspects of cybersecurity during development stages to ensure the application is secure and will work appropriately 
		with other security steps taken externally to the application. Channon would also require some programming skills and to some extent knowledge of database operations and management.</p>
