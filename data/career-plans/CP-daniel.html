		<h5>Ideal Job: Systems Administrator</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My ideal job is a Systems Administrator for a City. It involves working on a Network Services team, providing administration and technical 
		support of server infrastructure and project management for upgrades as well as providing back up support. It involves computer networks in a government environment. 
		Administering and developing corporate systems, servers, databases, and data storage interests me, As well as ensuring the integrity and availability of data and 
		email systems. There is also planning and developing server, storage, backup, disaster recovery, and network infrastructure solutions. The position of a Systems 
		Administrator is very different from Adam's ideal job of a Backend Developer and Channon's perfect job of Cyber Security Analyst as they are predominantly software-focused. 
		There are similarities to Madeline's perfect job of I.T. support officer, which also provides technical support and I.T. systems maintenance. There is also a lot of 
		crossover with Sam's perfect position of System Integration Officer as it too involves working with I.T. systems and networking, as does Jorge's ideal job of I.T. 
		Support Specialist.</p>
