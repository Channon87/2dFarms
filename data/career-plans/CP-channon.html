		<h5>Ideal Job: Cyber Security (field yet to be determined)</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">My ideal job will be in one of the fields of Cyber Security. The positions in cybersecurity vary in their own ways but keep the same basic knowledge 
		under them. My main reasoning for this is to protect from any cyber-attacks that are occurring or may occur in the future, to stay ahead of the hackers and implement 
		fixes to prevent any intrusion. It holds a lot of the skills I find exciting and enjoyable with the main one being the languages behind programming and how they can 
		be manipulated. I believe taking a role in this field will be beneficial as we all depend on secure systems, and the knowledge to achieve this will be highly sought after.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I believe my Ideal Job holds similarities to Adams as it has a lot of programming language based knowledge. There is some overlap of similarities with 
		the others; however, the primary goals are very different. To my understanding, Maddie's, Daniel's, Sam's and Jorge's all hold very similar aspects of work.</p>
