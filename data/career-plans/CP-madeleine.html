		<h5>Ideal Job: IT Support Officer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">My ideal job is to provide I.T. support to fellow staff members at SANE Australia. This requires a lot of problem-solving skills, 
		an understanding of Mac computers rather than Windows and very little programming skill.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">This is quite different from Adam's ideal job as he wishes to work behind the scenes as a backend developer, building the framework of 
		the software he creates. The job I chose does not involve this sort of creativity or programming skill. Channon's ideal position is similar to Adam's 
		in that it requires a lot of knowledge of programming languages and creativity, unlike my job selection.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I think my job is similar to Daniel's as he also chose a job that is based around providing I.T. support. However, his ideal job 
		does involve more responsibilities than mine, such as project management and development of the systems used by the company/government. I would say my 
		perfect job is similar to Sam's in that we both can see the reward in working to help others access the community/healthcare. However, Sam's job 
		revolves around developing, maintaining or enhancing business applications, whereas my job is to provide more general support for colleagues. 
		I think my ideal job is most similar to Jorge's perfect job because we both wish to work in I.T. support.</p>
