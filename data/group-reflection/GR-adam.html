		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Assessment 3 went like clockwork; we all knew what to expect from each team member and were aware of their 
		abilities from Assessment 2. We did mix up the roles a little this time around to address some concerns raised from the feedback 
		provided for the last assessment and for other team members to gain experience in different areas.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Meeting Schedules was improved slightly over the last Assignment but still has room for improvement. But honestly, 
		nothing is perfect. Beyond that, I can not fault anything else as I believe everything went well.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Again I was surprised how well our team functions together, the dynamic of the group is excellent and I would love 
		to work with this group of people in a more professional and employed manor in the future.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Like I  have previously mentioned, Teams work well when everyone gets along and shows a willingness to learn and 
		achieve the goals as a team and not as an individual. Knowing your team members abilities and shortcomings is essential to a successful project.</p>
