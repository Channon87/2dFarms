		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">We all worked fairly evenly towards the project. We were all willing and motivated to get started, allocate work 
		and get our pieces done. Each person worked hard to keep up with the group and attend as many meetings as possible. We got the correct
		number of sessions done, even if a few of us missed a session here or there.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I'm not sure that there was much to be improved. We were a strong group that supported each other where we had flaws 
		or contributed more to where we had strengths. We had no areas of conflict and discussed mildly different opinions calmly to come to the 
		most beneficial outcome. Perhaps we could have anticipated differing time zones a bit better, but we sorted that out eventually. We did 
		the best we could while learning to use M.S. Teams without and/much prior experience. Perhaps there were a few areas where we could have 
		met the word counts and didn't - but I wouldn't say we are missing much in the way of value, despite the word deficit. I wish I were a 
		little quicker to submit my pieces as I did lag for up to a few days here and there but caught up each time without issue. I don't believe 
		this created a problem amongst the group, but it is a good chance for me to improve in this area anyway.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">It was surprising how well we did. I expected there to be areas of conflict, lack of support, lack of motivation 
		or other limitations both inside or outside of our control. However, we did well, and I am very proud of what we did.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">They can work well. If I'm honest, I did not have high expectations for the group work, but I was blown away with 
		how much work we did, how well we communicated and how ready people were to be a part of the group. </p>
