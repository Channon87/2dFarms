		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">This time I feel the team was more relax working on this assignment. The idea of our project was 
		already established from A2, and it was easier to communicate and work together when we all have the same vision of what 
		we wanted to create. I am very proud of what the team have accomplished and been part of it.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">We could have improved communication.  I'm saying this because I think as the assignment's 
		become more complicated in the future, we might not be able to designate individual tasks and would have to work 
		more closely with all team members. But overall, it went well, Considering that we all have jobs and some have families 
		plus we live in different states with different time zones.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The commitment of every team member was outstanding. It shows that everyone in this team wants to 
		succeed in this course. Another thing that surprises me is that everyone is willing to help other team members.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The creativity of working in groups is fantastic. When you have six minds, focus on one objective. 
		Then things flow much more effortlessly.</p>
