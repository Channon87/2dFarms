		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3"></p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Everything went fairly smoothly considering the added freedom that was given to us as a group and therefore, 
		the added uncertainty that came along with it. There may have been room for improvement with our meeting schedule. But we made 
		it work well enough.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The momentum carried over from Assignment 2 was a pleasant surprise as this helped us immensely by allowing 
		us to feed off one another's energy and gave a sense of reassurance knowing we had each other's back and were indeed in this together.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My main takeaway from this group work is that it's not as daunting a task as I first had dreaded it would be, 
		though I have the feeling I lucked out by being in a good group as I have heard other groups had trouble in several areas of group work.</p>
