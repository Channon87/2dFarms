		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">After assignment 2, we had developed a great sense of comradery. I was happy to engage with other team members, and 
		I think they felt the same. During meetings, it felt like I was talking to friends. Everyone was eager to adopt roles and perform tasks, 
		and there were no conflicts with other team members.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Scheduling was more difficult during this assessment as this time of year is busier for most team members. This 
		created some misunderstandings which lead to some team members not being present during some meetings. Procedures ensuring team members 
		regularly check for updates and correspondence will improve scheduling issues in the future.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">This assessment allowed team members to express their creativity, and they could really showcase their talents. 
		Creating characters for promotional materials and editing created content allowed team members to utilise skills which were not as 
		apparent in previous assignments.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Typically, I am hesitant during group tasks. It can be challenging to work with strangers, and If there is not a 
		good balance among team members, it can be challenging to be motivated for tasks. If there is a right team environment and everyone is 
		on friendly terms, willing to help each other, the problems associated with group work in minimised significantly.</p>
