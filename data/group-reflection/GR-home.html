		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The main consensus as to what went well was bought on by the success we saw from doing Assignment 2. With all 
		introductions out of the way, we had a better understanding of what the strengths and weaknesses of each other were. The group we 
		had made it easy to progress as there were no issues as to what we would set out to achieve and any items that needed collaboration 
		were decided on quickly. Believing in our project idea was also a real benefit to having everyone in the group on board with the 
		direction we wanted to go made completing this task relative simplistic.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The main problem we had during these two assignments would be scheduling. We all have busy lives, and our 
		timetables differed more in these weeks, although we managed to get some good meetings in we may have been able to add some more, 
		however, did not want any team member to miss out. The last part of the year is typically hectic for most people and with the lift 
		of restrictions for most a lot of catching up of other works needed to be done. All things considered, we all believe we still had 
		enough meetings and collaboration time but could have improved some deadlines and achieved more if had extras.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Surprising to many of us was the open creativity that was allowed in these assignments allowing different 
		talents to be highlighted of each member. Once again, even with the busy timetables, we all had in the end, the commitment to get 
		these tasks done was outstanding. We all want to see each other succeed in this course, and even some of the conversations off-topic
		allowed for further understanding of each other and built up more comradery. </p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Working in this group is excellent, we all now know that if everyone has the same goals to reach for and do not
		work just for themselves, it goes smoothly. Learning about your team members, even some items not related to the fields of the task 
		allow you to delegate work efficiently and keep to deadlines. The other thing we learnt mainly more from the other teams in the course 
		is also how badly they can work if you have one or more dragging you back; it can put a massive dent into progression. It's all about 
		how a group can adapt and fill in any downfalls that may be bought on by these circumstances.</p>
