		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Much to the same of assignment 2, I believe everything went well. With the mark, we received put us in an excellent 
		place to continue the dedication into the third and fifth assignment. We decided to continue with the development of our idea before the feedback received, 
		which I believe gave us a slight leg up to other groups, possibly. We believed in what we had done prior and went on assuming this.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">In terms of improving its typically hard to say with the project idea, although we were all in the same boat with what we were doing 
		maybe some ideas of how it worked were left to pass. With specific tasks received for the input of the assignment, some were unsure as to parts of the program 
		which we could have made more transparent for understanding to them.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Surprising to me, was the sheer trust we had after our earlier assignment. We all knew what each other could do so the need for extra 
		communication was minimal as we believed it what each other would do. The other thing is the extra effort once someone had completed there set task to help 
		in others that were not assigned to them to make sure the project was completed by the date given.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I learnt after this session that you can work in a group with minimal conversation and still achieve a finished product. It was the same 
		for assignment 2 just more trust was given this time, and I believe we were not hindered by it. The more you get to know your group members, the more you 
		understand what they would be right at and setting those roles is a huge benefit to everyone.</p>
