		<h4>Detailed Description</h4>
		<h5>Aims</h5>
		<p class="pt-2"><strong>General overview:</strong><br />
		Our project idea is to deliver a basic application that would be able to do a privacy settings 
		scan for the user's account.  The scan would warn the user if their privacy in social media (Facebook) has been infringed. For example, 
		if your Facebook profile is public, then the application would tell the user their information is available to everyone, and they can 
		change it to a more private configuration.  Our aim for this project is to make the user aware of the risks of not having a healthy 
		privacy setting in their social media account. As for now, our primary goal would be the creation of the User interface and make it, 
		so it would be functional enough to be proof of our project idea.  To achieve this, we have listed a series of steps that we have to 
		accomplish for the application to be completed.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
			<strong>List of goals to achieve for the application development</strong><br />
			<ul class="pb-3">
				<li>Develop the user interface by using Figma's interface design application.</li>
				<li>Use Bravo studio to add tags and menus, videos, retrieve data from API and preview the application </li>
			</ul>		
		</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3"><strong>What are the most important parts of the project?</strong><br/>
		The development of user interface is the essential part of this project as it would display the work that we 
		want to create, as mentioned previously, it would only be a proof of concept.</p> 
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3"><strong>What should have priority:</strong><br />
		The user interface and a workable application will be the main focus for the initial stages. 
		If time is allowing the next most vital part to the project to be workable, we would need to introduce data scraping to some extent even 
		if it only allows the most basic setting to be made visible to our creation at least the proof to achieve all setting datum points would 
		be made sound and the project should achieve its full functionality in the future progression.</p>
