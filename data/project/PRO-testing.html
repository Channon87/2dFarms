		<h4>Detailed Description</h4>
		<h5>Testing</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">Our project will be tested in 2 phases before its full release. The first testing will be the ALPHA stage in which it will be 
		tested in house by the development team. Once the application is deemed to be useable, it will be released into BETA, which will be open testing 
		of the public. The Beta phase will be missing some tutorial videos, but links will be included to blank placeholders, the main features of the 
		scanning and suggested fixes will be implemented.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The testing coverage we need would be tech-savvy people that understand the best settings to make and to ensure or scraping is 
		picking up on all settings they are meant to. Would also need a pool of people unsure of settings as they would possibly have most settings set 
		wrong. To achieve these test pools our YouTube video should hopefully get some but rather would use in house contacts for the first pool and on 
		the street marketing at shopping centres where you usually see people's faces planted to their phones to get the second pool, another option is 
		to get a social influencer on board.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The mix of persons we would need to have would include all age brackets as we hope to make it useable by even the least 
		technological person. We would hope to achieve at least 500 in each pool to get some detailed bug tracking prior to full release BETA testing 
		should conclude after a 4 to 5 week period.</p>
