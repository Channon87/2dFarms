		<h5>Risks</h5>

		<p class="pt-2">
		The risks that we foresee specific to our project are the efficacy of our tutorial videos because the purpose of our applicationis
		to make users more secure and increase privacy and not being able to directly implement the changes ourselves we are 100% relying
		on the user to fulfil the application's purpose. So if a user cannot understand our tutorial videos and makethe changes required,
		then we have failed at our mission statement.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		As the applicationwon't be able to make any of the changes to a user's social media account itself due to the limitations imposed
		by the social media platforms to their APIs and will have to rely on the user successfully following tutorials, human error may mean
		some changes may not take effect. Still,the user will think they have, lulling them into a false sense of security, however, in this case,
		the applicationwill notify the user again, the user may give up making the changes if the task is too laborious or complicated which it
		sometimes can be when navigating social media security settings -they aren't always the easiest to locate.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		Another risk is if we have unexpected difficultiesexecuting our initial check of settings. There are many moving parts here, so the risk is
		elevated. Still,with careful considerations like more time and increased personnel on standby during development, these risks can be limited
		as much as possible.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		Also, a potential risk is the need to have the applicationrunning in the background to allow it to provide notifications about setting changes
		and possibly the need for the applicationto be updated periodically.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
		Another potential obstacle we anticipate is keeping up with the changes promptly and having new tutorial videos ready. The tutorial videos must
		also be easy to follow and aimed at novices which will need testing -the videos could seem easy to follow to ourselves who have I.T. experience,
		but we may leave some people behind. We will keep this in mind during development to make sure the applicationis effective. With appropriate
		measures and safeguards,we believe this applicationhas the potential to make areal difference in improving social media security and privacy,
		so it can be used safely, and be the enjoyable experience it set out to be, without the risk.</p>
