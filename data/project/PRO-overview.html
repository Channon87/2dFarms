		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<h5>Topic</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">Our I.T. project would be an Application capable of identifying security issues and privacy information breaches 
		in the user's account. We are allowing the user to have more control and knowledge about their information privacy. The project, in its 
		entirety, is heavily based on the application we are making and to further it to work with many other social media platforms in the future. 
		In its baby stage, we will cover Facebook as we see this as the primary entity, but if the base concept works, it could be used in many 
		other forms.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Apart from the application itself, our project relies heavily on marketing. With some applications that do relatively 
		the same thing as listed below, we were not aware of these before having the idea; it shows that without good marketing skills and an 
		easy-to-use application U.I. it could be doomed to fail, however, if we can produce it to be as simple as possible but also market it 
		effectively, we should stand higher than the others. At the end of production, the goals we set out would be to have a majority of 
		users of Facebook also having our application however if we can at least make it a talking point we could see changes in these systems 
		themselves which we would deem to be a win also.</p>

		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The motivation for developing such a project comes from all of us "The Fighting Mongooses" having questioned the practices 
		that the different social media applications have done with their terms and conditions. The most important problem we saw is how they can 
		collect the user's data and then sell it, getting the users browsing history and target the user with annoying publicity or even some of 
		them reaching further and trying to gain influence in the user. An example of this is what happened in the Cambridge Analytica case.</p> 
		
		<h5>Landscape</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">Right now, there are so many different applications that have similar features to what we want to create.  In its initial
		stage, the application would only work with Facebook. The user would allow the application to scan the user's account searching for privacy violations, 
		that we would define by algorithms we determine to be the best possible outcome for the user.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Our application is a work in progress, and it would have only a few functions for now, but it would keep on expanding more functionalities.  
		In comparison with other applications that are in the market, applications like Defend x security suite, defend x privacy advisor and privacy advisor pro 
		they all do the privacy scan for your social media in a similar way to what the mongoose application would do.</p>

				<li>The application would ask for permission to</li>
				<li>Scan now, - authorisations. -scan the post -public-friends only </li>
				<li>Would scan and flag posts that are public. Then the user can change the settings to private if they wish to do so.</li>
				<li>Would check the security settings from their profile that had been set by default, then showing the user if they wish to change any of the settings to a more private setting.</li>
