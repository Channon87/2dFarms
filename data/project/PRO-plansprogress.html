		<strong>General overview:</strong><br /><br />
		<strong>How it began:</strong><br />
		Social media plays a significant part in how we communicate and share information. As the technology of social media progresses, more and more of 
		the user's data is utilised, and the more public our lives become. Encapsulating the findings of Taneja, Vitrano and Gengo (2014, p.159), for users 
		to get the most out of their social media experience, they are required to share their personal information. Consequentially, this stresses the 
		importance of privacy settings when using social media. While social media was still emerging into the mainstream, many users were not aware that 
		their personal data and privacy was at risk. Tuunainen, Pitk√§nen and Hovi's findings (2009, p.7) indicate that early adopters of social media were 
		unaware of the amount of personally identifiable information had been published on social media platforms. Issues concerning privacy on social media 
		were brought into the mainstream during Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Third-party apps were able to harvest the data of over 50 million 
		Facebook users. This data was then used for targeted political advertising. Chan (2019) writes that the Cambridge Analytica scandal directly affected 
		the 2016 USA presidential election, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz each paying $5million to Cambridge Analytica to have access over the data, and then 
		targeted political advertisements towards users who were more prone to conspiratorial thinking.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Despite social media users becoming more aware of how their privacy is at risk, most users do not keep up to date lengthy and 
		constant changing terms and conditions. Furthermore, Taneja, Vitrano and Gengo (2014, p.160) argue that many users may feel shame using more strict 
		social media privacy settings as they feel other may believe that they have something to hide. The developers at the Fighting Mongooses understand 
		that control of privacy settings is the easiest way to avoid risks associated with the misuse of private data. The Fighting Mongooses have been 
		developing an application to simplify how users can keep up to date with their terms and conditions and which privacy controls are suited for them.  
		The Fighting Mongooses hope to use humour through promotional material and easy to follow tutorial material to help normalise the use of privacy 
		controls and reduce user apprehension and stigma using such measures.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>How it progressed:</strong><br />
		The concept idea for the project was first conceived during the second assessment, where we all agreed to develop Adam's idea that he put forward 
		during brainstorming, from there everything started to take the direction of what we were going to do. At the start of the third assessment, during 
		our group meetings, we decided to divide the workload into teams and report our progress in the next conferences and present if we have any issues 
		or dead ends in the project topics. We kept this run more open to trust in everyone to get done what needed to be done if anyone fell behind others 
		would help and if any questions needed to be answered asap, we were usually always available.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">From our first meeting, we first discuss ideas for assessment 5, what the presentation would be like. We collaborated in the 
		ideas to develop the exhibition during the next three meetings until we reached the final cut. There were weekly and at times daily updates to the 
		scenes created and the sounds which were put up to poll to see if everyone was in agreeance with how each individual scene progressed, any changes 
		that had to be made we implemented to achieve the best possible result. At the same time, we defined the limits of our I.T. project and made changes 
		accordingly to produce a working product.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Weekly progress:</strong><br />
		A follow up of week by week on how the group of The Fighting Mongooses have progressed over the past weeks in the project development</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2"><strong><i>Week 1 - 28/10/20</i></strong><br />
		In this first meeting we touch the topic of creating the storyboard for our Assessment 5 presentations, as well we talk about how it would be 
		the most efficient way to start working on Assessment 3, the decision was to work in groups of 2 and divide the workload </p>

		<p class="pt-2"><strong><i>Week 2 - 04/11/20</i></strong><br />
		Reporting into the second week, we had our topics divided in the following

			During this week, the GitHub repository was created, and the progress made was uploaded into GitHub and Microsoft teams. Adam and Channon were elected to 
			work on the application development as well as the website for Adam and the presentation creation by Channon.
		</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2"><strong><i>Week 3 - 11/11/20</i></strong><br />
		The first contributions were completed and uploaded to GitHub and Microsoft teams, while they still in a draft version more changes would be coming over the next week.</p>

		<p class="pt-2"><strong><i>Week 4 - 18/11/20</i></strong><br />
		During this week, the project app is being created with Figma. Also, the content of the report is being finalised in draft form, for everyone to read and make changes 
		if needed. The final cut of the presentation was put forward to collaborate on. </p>
		
		<p class="pt-2"><strong><i>Week 5 - 25/11/20</i></strong><br />
		Completion of reports and some initial testing of software was made viable, however, still away from being complete. Promotional content uploaded to get the word out.
		Lost a member of the team has lost contact, which had unfinished content, so Channon took those sections to complete with everyone collaborating on the product that was produced.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Original concept/ design:</strong><br />
		The purpose of The Fighting Mongooses' flagship product is to make it easier for the user to interact and understand their privacy settings using social media. 
		Therefore, the product is designed to be intuitive and straightforward to use. Avoiding the use of complicated menus and functions, the user simply utilises the function of 
		a single button, and further user prompts are displayed as they are needed. Setting up privacy settings on all the user's devices and social media accounts can be a complicated 
		task. It is vital that each stage of the Mongoose Security app provides a simple experience for the user.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Future versions of the program may increase the functions and useability of the application; however, development of the application will 
		always prioritise simplicity and a user-friendly interface.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Updates and changes:</strong><br />
		There have been no significant changes or updates from the initial stages of development for the application. All user interface decisions and development processes 
		have been consistent since the initial stages of development and planning. There have been a few changes. Initially, the application was intended to utilise scraping 
		data and APIs. It was made apparent in the initial stages of development that APIs are somewhat challenging to obtain and are frequently updated. This would require 
		more resources to regularly check and maintain software to keep up with the ever-changing APIs. To reduce a constant workload, it was decided that the application would 
		exclusively utilise scrap data for the time being. This would require The Fighting Mongooses only to make changes when Facebook or other relevant social media platforms 
		made design changes themselves. Future versions may begin to implement APIs as more resources become available.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">It was decided after the initial stages of development that paid ads would be added to a free version of the product. In order to not compromise 
		on our company's mission and protect user's privacy, no invasive or target adds will be permitted. Adds will solely be from virtual private network companies to promote 
		safe and protected internet usage. These advertisements are relevant to the target audience for the application.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Software implemented:</strong><br />
		The application would be created with two different software programs, Figma and Bravo studio. First, with Figma, we can create and test the basic structure of the application. 
		With this software, we can start adding shapes and forms that would give the Mongoose security app its design. For this first step, we would be using the prototype function to 
		develop the first concept ideas for the app.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Secondly, from Figma we can connect the application design to bravo studio, in bravo we can add containers or blocks of content that would display 
		the information for the user.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
		<strong>Meetings and communication:</strong><br />
		Our team communication process happens in Microsoft teams. We organise weekly meetings to discuss and report our progress and brainstorm on a particular subject we 
		might be working during that week. The sessions are chaired by one of the team members who follow the agenda which is usually kept to a minimalistic approach with 
		only main dot points, as we go through the agenda topics the discussion opens-up and we start to participate and give our opinions and ideas. This is how most of 
		our meetings have been progressing during our course.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Testing features and user interface:</strong><br />
		Testing procedures, alpha testing (just us) majority of the program will be made workable in the initial stages the testing, however, will have boundaries as the number of profiles we will have to work on. </p>
		<p class="pt-2">Beta - nightly builds, open on the app store. Needing more profiles to test on this will be an open beta available to any user that wishes to trial it. Having input into the creation is rewarded to anyone that helps test hopefully bringing in more subjects. </p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Full release - paid option and free tier after initial stages of release</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
		<strong>Creating promotional material and tutorials:</strong><br />
		The creation of promotional content and the tutorials is a vital part of the progression of the Fighting Mongooses' products and engaging with our clients. We opted for a more light-hearted approach 
		towards promotional videos, trying to pique people's interest with humorous videos. The tutorials, however, are to be made professionally with sound editing to make as crisp as possible and easy to 
		understand. Another key aspect was to make them as short and compressed as possible to fit within the app to use as little room as possible. Further promotional content will be made in the future with 
		the same ideals of keeping it as memorable as possible. All of these are to be made using open-source software to keep costings down.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
		<strong>What stage are we up to?:</strong><br />
		Currently, we are still in development with some alpha testing on the main U.I. Once all the kinks are taken out of the U.I. links, we can add content to these. We are also working on the process 
		of how our application will scrape user data and implement that into our project. This will be unachievable by report time, however, should be implemented prior to a beta release.</p>
