		<h4>Detailed Description</h4>
		<h5>Scopes and Limits</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">The scope of our project is to provide an application that checks a user's security and privacy settings for Facebook and gives 
		corresponding recommendations to alter settings to increase security and privacy. We have limited it to an Apple and Android application with plans 
		to produce a Windows application in the future when we expand our capabilities. Another limit we have imposed is to focus on Facebook as the sole 
		social media platform; the application will be compatible with and have the ability to scan the security and privacy settings of the user. Though 
		once again, when our organisation increases, so will our scope, and we plan to add other social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter as 
		we move forward and grow.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">One of the significant limitations of our application is our current inability to change any security and privacy settings directly 
		through the application and are instead going down the route of offering tutorial videos that the users can be instructed by and implement the changes 
		themselves. This might change in the future if the company's open up added functionality through their API's that allow more control via third-party 
		applications. However, this is unlikely so we will instead try and continuously fine-tune our tutorial videos through user feedback to make them as 
		easy to follow as possible.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">In conclusion, with consideration of the scope and limits our proof of concept will be an application compatible with Android 
		and Apple smartphones which scans Facebook's security and privacy settings and recommends changes with tutorial videos available to guide the user 
		to implement the changes. This will be our deliverable.</p>
