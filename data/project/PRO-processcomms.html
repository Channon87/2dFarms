		<h4>Detailed Description</h4>
		<h5>Group Processes and Communications</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The Fighting Mongooses has always maintained a constant stream of communication among team members. For the Fighting Mongooses, communication has been the
			key to past successes and plays a vital role in maintaining our integrity and quality towards currentand future projects.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Expected frequency of communication:</strong><br />
		Because the team at The Fighting Mongooses is separated geographically and by multiple time zones, we understand the importance of maintaining a
		constant stream of communication. Correspondence occurs almost daily as colleagues update their progress on set tasks and using tools such as GitHuband
		Microsoft Teamsmeans that everyone is up to date with each other's contributions.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>How we communicate:</strong><br />
		The majority of correspondence is done through Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams allows us to host video calls/ meetings, share and collaborate with each
		other's files, message each other directly and set team goals. Furthermore, The Fighting Mongooses extensively utilises GitHub to store all data and maintain version control.
		This allows further collaboration, especially where multiple team members are working on the same task together and maintains a record of every adjustment and step
		taken towards our set goals. Informal correspondence has also been maintained through Discord. This plays a vital role in generating a positive and fun atmosphere
		among our team members as it provides a casual forum to discuss minor questions that aren't necessarily important enough to publish on Microsoft Teams or to discuss unrelated topics.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>Official Meetings and frequency:</strong><br />
		The Fighting Mongooses have arranged to have a minimum one official meeting each week with the flexibility for more meetings each week if necessary. Meetings are
		conducted solely using Microsoft Teams with each meeting being recorded. The recordings are stored both on Microsoft Teams and GitHub, allowing redundancy in
		the event one service is down and provides multiple options for reviewing previous meetings.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">
		<strong>If a team member does not respond or is inactive:</strong><br />
		The Fighting Mongooses is fortunate enough to have a dedicated team of individuals who have proven themselves to be reliable despite the difficulties of operating
		purely online.  In the event that a team member is inactive for a period of 3 days,and we are unable to communicate, we will contact RMIT faculty to determine the
		status of that team member's enrolment. If the team member is no longer enrolled or can not be communicated with by RMIT, the tasks set for the inactive team member
		will be dispersed among the remaining team members.</p>
